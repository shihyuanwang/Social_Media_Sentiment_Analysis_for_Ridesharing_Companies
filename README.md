# Social Media Sentiment and Emotion Analysis for Ridesharing Companies – Uber VS. Lyft

The purpose of this project is to detect “Tweets” and “Apple App Store app review” sentiments for the Top 2 ridesharing companies in the United States – Uber and Lyft. 

The project is aimed to answer the following questions:
1.	What are recent customer sentiment and emotional responses for the companies?
2.	How could companies improve their products and services based on customer feedback?
3.	Would customer sentiment influence the companies’ stock price (the selected indicator for financial results)?


In the project, tweets containing the names of the companies - “Uber” and “Lyft” - and Apple App Store “Uber” and “Lyft” app ratings and reviews were used to evaluate the potential financial impact (stock price) and provide suggestions for improvements.
