 After years of using the service Uber I must say they never let me down I currently hold arating and my drivers really represent that Holding each other to a certain standard when driving is important As well as mutual respect With uber being such a simple app to navigate really anyone can use it It offers the change to also make the right choice aAfter a night of drinking with buddies you can get a safe reliable ride home using this app This is the first time something like this has been available OF course we have taxi service but it is not the same Drivers often offer free water and phone charger upon arrival After being out charging your phone is a real treat due to it generally being dead Not only do they have regular rides you can select different vehicle options at different price points If you need a car for a larger party you can select that when placing your pickup location For example youre spending the day snowboarding On the app you can request a car with a ski rack to store your gear for a warm ride back to your lodge Another advantage to it is you see the price of the ride before its placed so its not a surprise All together I really enjoy this app as a safe way to travel and a reliable way as well I would strongly recommend it and therefore I give it astar rating",2020-12-07 22:43:06,2,6,2,4,5,3,3,9,4,17,10.75
